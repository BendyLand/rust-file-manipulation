# Rust File Manipulation

## Purpose

This project is to help me practice using Rust's borrow checker, as well as introduce me to more intermediate Rust concepts, such as lifetimes. 

## Usage

This program currently does nothing. The input file I will be using is the [list of languages hosted on Github](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).
